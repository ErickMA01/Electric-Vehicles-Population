## Electric-Vehicles-Population
In this project, I will be conducting EDA on an Electric Vehicles Population data set. 
My main objective will be to identify whether there are duplicates rows and missing values in the data set.
I will then remove duplicates and fix missing values if they are found.
Finally, I will create some vizualizations to get a better understanding of the data set.
